# ðŸš— Smart Car Parking System using Arrays

A smart car parking lot management application built using **C**, focusing on **array-based structures**. This project simulates real-world parking operations including vehicle registration, space allocation, membership tracking, revenue generation, and slot management.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Register new or returning vehicles with full owner details
- Allocate parking space based on membership level
- Calculate total parking hours and charges
- Manage Gold, Premium, and Non-member benefits
- Update and upgrade membership levels based on parking hours
- Maintain and update parking space status (Free/Occupied)
- Sort and view:
  - Vehicles by number of parkings
  - Vehicles by total revenue generated
  - Parking spaces by frequency of use
  - Parking spaces by revenue generated
- File handling (`data.txt`) for persistent data storage
- Implemented using **arrays of structures** for both vehicles and parking slots

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

This C project models a real-world smart parking system using **arrays** to store and manage vehicle and parking slot data. Vehicles are tracked by their number, entry/exit times, parking history, and revenue. The parking lot intelligently assigns slots based on membership and updates all data dynamically.
